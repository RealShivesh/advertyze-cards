# Card browser

This project was performed in accordance to the assignment task for the front-end internship.

## Methods used

In this directory, the following methods and tools were used:

### Create-react-app

This was used as a foundation for the react app.

### React hooks

For the useState and useEffect, hooks were used for the local state in the function components, while useEffect was used for the lifecycle effects.

### Async function

To fetch the API using the onClick feature of button, I created an async function to call the data of the API.

### SASS

Instead of conventional CSS, I used SASS in order to write CSS files with ease and wider compatibility.
